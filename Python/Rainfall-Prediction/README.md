This program is all about giving input and expecting the program to throw a prediction about the weather!

In the datacleaning.py file I have added a code that clear out the previously stored data and starts out a fresh data.
In the raindata.py file we have the main program which is used to train and predict.

I hope its meaningful and error free.

Thankyou!!
